# Dad-Jokes-ReactJS

Simple API call app. Used 2 components, Joke and JokeList. First i make a call to that api: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ <br>
As a respond i get a JSON of joke which has, ID, Joke and status value. <br>
I convert them into object and store into state array. <br>
First, got 10 jokes <br> If we click joke button we get another joke with another call. If its duplicate joke it is not shown in jokelist component. Controlled with Set data structure.
